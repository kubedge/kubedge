# Contributing to Kubedge

Kubedge is an open source project.

## Filing issues

When [filing an issue](https://github.com/kubedge/kubedge/issues/new), make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?

General questions should go to the [kubedge](https://kubedge.cloud) instead of the issue tracker.
